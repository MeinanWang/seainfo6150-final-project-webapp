Add honey, .33 cup water, and 2 tablespoons olive oil, and stir vigorously until dough forms a cohesive ball. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let rest until Step 3.",
            "Rinse all produce. Peel carrots, then cut into .5-inch dice (see recipe tip). Halve lemons. Roughly chop cilantro and parsley, keeping stems and leaves separate. Peel onion, halve, and cut into small dice. Mince garlic. On a baking sheet, toss carrots with 1.5 tablespoons olive oil, .75 teaspoon salt, and pepper as desired. Line a separate baking sheet with parchment paper. ",
            "Sprinkle reserved flour onto a clean, dry surface, coating a rolling pin with a thin layer. Roll dough into a rectangular shape, rotating frequently and working from center to edges, until .125-inch thick.

Bake crackers and carrots until crackers are crisp and carrots are tender, 21-24 minutes.",

When oil is shimmering, add spice mix, parsley stems, cilantro stems, onion, and garlic. Cook, stirring, until softened, 3-4 minutes. Stir in tomato paste to combine, 1 minute.

            "Increase heat under soup to high and bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium high and simmer until flavors have melded, 7-8 minutes. Remove from heat and cover to keep warm. Once baked, add carrots to blender along with soup and process until completely smooth, 1 minute (see recipe tip). Adjust consistency by adding more water as needed until smooth and pourable. Taste and add salt and pepper as desired. ",
